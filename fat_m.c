// NOTE This library has no concept of what time and date it currently is.
//       All files and folders created or modified using this library
//       will have invalid/inaccurate timestamps and datestamps.

// NOTE To save on ROM and RAM space, the user of this library will have to 
//       define what type of FAT they will be working with. The defines are 
//       in the Useful Defines section below.

// NOTE For faster writing or appending for an application such as a logger, 
//       uncomment #FAST_FAT below.  This will make the FAT library assume 
//       there is one file on the card to write or append to, thereby
//       making writing and appending much faster. Reading is impossible in 
//       this mode.
//       THIS IS NOT TESTED VERY WELL YET!

// NOTE The current maximum file name length (full path) is 32 characters 
//       long. If longer file names are desired, change the 
//       MAX_FILE_NAME_LENGTH define below. Creating a file whose full path 
//       is longer than MAX_FILE_NAME_LENGTH may lead to weird operation. Keep
//       in mind that making this define larger will make your RAM usage go 
//        up.
